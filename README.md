My configuration files for ZSH, vim etc.

To install, run './install'. It will create symlinks in your home folder, pointing to the files and directories in the 'config' directory.

Any existing files or folders will be moved to a backup directory, stated by the script. The contents of the backup directory are ignored by git.
