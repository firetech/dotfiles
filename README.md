Dotfiles
========

My configuration files for ZSH, vim etc. The files are best suited for Debian and derived Linux distros, but at least the ZSH config is quite adaptive.

Installation
============

To install, run './install'. It will create symlinks in your home folder, pointing to the files and directories in the 'config' directory.

Any existing files or folders will be moved to a backup directory, stated by the script. The contents of the backup directory are ignored by git.
